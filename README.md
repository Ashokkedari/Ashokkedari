## Hey there! 👋  

I'm **Ashok**, a Computer Science learner and aspiring Software Engineer.  

I enjoy building projects and turning ideas into real applications. 

My main technical focus includes **Python,Java, SQL, Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), DBMS, OOPS, Computer Networks, Operating Systems, and Cloud fundamentals**. 

I also have hands-on exposure to **Machine Learning basics and Data Analytics concepts** through certifications and practice projects.   

I've got multiple pinned repositories, but my favorites include **Machine learning and Data Analytics Repos**.  

I've built few public repos, but privately.. it's probably more than 20 at this point

If you want to see how I learn and build, feel free to explore my repositories!
