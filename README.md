## Hey there! 👋  

I'm **Ashok**, a Computer Science learner and aspiring Software Engineer.  
I build projects that strengthen my fundamentals and turn ideas into working solutions.  

If a problem catches my interest, chances are I’ll analyze it, code it, and optimize it.  

My main technical focus includes **Python, SQL, DSA, DBMS, OOPS, Computer Networks, and Cloud fundamentals**.  
My favorite tools are **VS Code, GitHub, and debugging tools** for clean and efficient development.  

I've got multiple pinned repositories, but my favorites include **DSA practice projects and mini system implementations**.  

I've built several public repositories — and privately, I'm constantly experimenting and improving my skills.  

If you want to see how I learn and build, feel free to explore my repositories!
